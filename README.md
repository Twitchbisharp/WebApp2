# WebApp2

This is a continuation of project 1 of the course ITPE3200 - Webapplikasjoner.
The additional functionality included in this expansion is front-end functionalities implmented through Angular.

The requirements for this project are as following:

## The project consists of an application and a short documentation. 

An application must be implemented (including the front-end and back-end), using .NET as the back-end framework (you can reuse the back-end from Group project 1) and Angular/React as the front-end framework for the same task in Group Project 1.
In addition, a short documentation of 1000-3000 words (in English) must be written, which preferably includes some diagrams, e.g., UML.

## Requirements
- [x] Create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) solution of one of the tasks.
- [x] .NET Core. (6.0 or later) on the back-end.
- [x] React or Angular on the front-end.

### Basic requirements:
- [x] The application should not crash.
- [x] The application must have a front-end user interface with interactive form in the form of a web page.
- [x] CRUD (create, read, update, delete) must be supported in the task for at least one entity in the task.
- [ ] A documentation that explains the project.

### Addition requirements (that serve as guidelines for improving quality in 3 dimensions):
User experience, including:
- [ ] Basic design, not plain text and bare buttons
- [x] Dynamic content
- [x] Friendly navigation
Coding style and documentation, including:
- [x] Neat code, structured, and modularised
- [ ] Understandable code, either self-explanatory or with suitable comments (in English)
- [ ] Good documentation (in the short documentation) that clarifies project architecture, functionality and how they are coded.

Functionality, including:
- [x] Database operation with more than 1 type of entity (including component and CRUD)
- [x] Service injection (client-side)
- [ ] Custom pipe - Least Likely to do
- [x] Forms and input validation (client-side)
- [x] Error handling and logging (server-side)
- [x] Content filtering (client-side)
- [ ] Unit testing, at least including the complete positive tests and negative tests for each CRUD method (where testing is meaningful) of 1 entity/table (server-side)
